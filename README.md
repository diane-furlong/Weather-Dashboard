#Weather-Dashboard


## Description 

This project is a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. This goal of this assignment is to create a weather dashboard with current weather conditions and a five-day forecast for whatever city a user inputs. Basic HTML was provided and the student was to write the JavaScript.<br>

The purpose of this homework assignment is to practice retrieving data from another application's API and integrating this information in our own application.<br>

The user story of this assignment was: <br>
AS A traveler<br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly<br><br>

The acceptance criteria given in the assignment is as follows:<br>

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br><br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br><br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br><br>
WHEN I view the UV index<br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe<br><br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity<br><br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history<br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city<br><br>
